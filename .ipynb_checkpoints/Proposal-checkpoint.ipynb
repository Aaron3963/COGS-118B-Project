    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project must include some elements of unsupervised learning, but you are welcome to include some supervised or other learning approaches as well.\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "The exponential growth of the computer gaming industry into a multi-billion dollar industry shows its widespread popularity and economic significance. However, the industry faces unique challenges, such as the difficulty in satisfying a multicultural player base. Research indicates that implementing discount strategies is a crucial business tactic for bringing up sales in the competitive market. <a name=\"dunote\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#dunote)Previous studies have focused on predicting the timing of discounts for games, leveraging historical data to predict when price reductions are likely to occur.<a name=\"linnote\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#linnote) Building on this foundation, our research aims to predict not just the timing but the specific discount rates of computer games on steam."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "We are aiming to predict the discount price of games in Steam. Games in steam are all labeled with tags and features, which makes it perfect for clustering algorithms. Though tags are generated by users, we can still transform it into one-hot encoding for it to be quantifiable. Measuring should be easy as we can use accuracy for predict prices, or use distance for clustering performance. We will use fixed seed to ensure the algorithm is replicable."

    "\n",
    "The Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) measures the similarity between two clusterings, considering all pairs of samples and counting pairs that are assigned in the same or different clusters in the predicted and true clusterings. The ARI is adjusted for the chance grouping of elements, making it a more reliable metric for the quality of the clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE will give us a direct measure of the accuracy of the price predictions, while ARI will assess the effectiveness of our clustering, ensuring that the foundation for our predictions—how games are grouped based on tags and features—is sound. This dual approach allows us to optimize both the clustering of games and the accuracy of the price predictions."
