    "# Abstract \n",
    "This study aims to predict the discount prices of games on Steam, along with the rich metadata and user-generated tags associated with each game. The dataset comprises 71,700 entries, game titles, original and discounted prices, release dates, developer and publisher information, supported languages, popular user tags, game features, and minimum requirements. These entries are primarily textual and categorical, with numerical representations for prices. Our methodology involves preprocessing the data, including handling missing values and transforming user-generated tags into one-hot encoded vectors to quantify the categorical data effectively. We will explore the dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover underlying patterns and relationships. The study will then apply clustering techniques, specifically DBSCAN, Spectral Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), to group games based on their tags and features. This clustering will serve as a foundation for predicting game discount prices. The performance of our price prediction model will be evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), while the effectiveness of our clustering approach will be assessed using the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of both the accuracy of price predictions and the quality of game groupings."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The exponential growth of the computer gaming industry into a multi-billion dollar industry shows its widespread popularity and economic significance. However, the industry faces unique challenges, such as the difficulty in satisfying a multicultural player base. Research indicates that implementing discount strategies is a crucial business tactic for bringing up sales in the competitive market. <a name=\"dunote\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#dunote)Previous studies have focused on predicting the timing of discounts for games, leveraging historical data to predict when price reductions are likely to occur.<a name=\"linnote\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#linnote) Building on this foundation, our research aims to predict not just the timing but the specific discount rates of computer games on steam."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "We are aiming to predict the discount price of games in Steam. Games in steam are all labeled with tags and features, which makes it perfect for clustering algorithms. Though tags are generated by users, we can still transform it into one-hot encoding for it to be quantifiable. Measuring should be easy as we can use accuracy for predict prices, or use distance for clustering performance. We will use fixed seed to ensure the algorithm is replicable."

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the challenge of predicting discount prices for Steam games and effectively clustering them based on tags and features, we propose a multi-faceted solution leveraging DBSCAN, Spectral Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models(GMM).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):\n",
    "DBSCAN is chosen for its ability to identify clusters of varying shapes and sizes without the need for specifying the number of clusters a priori. This characteristic is particularly advantageous given the diverse and potentially irregular groupings of games based on tags. DBSCAN works by grouping closely packed points and identifying points in low-density areas as outliers. This method is expected to effectively segregate games into meaningful clusters based on similarity in tags and features, which are pivotal for predicting discount prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spectral Clustering:\n",
    "Spectral Clustering is selected for its effectiveness in identifying complex structures within data. It works by using the eigenvalues of a similarity matrix to perform dimensionality reduction before clustering in lower dimensions. This approach is particularly suited for our dataset since it can capture the intricate relationships between games based on their tags and features, which might not be linearly separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):\n",
    "GMM is a probabilistic model that assumes all data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters. It offers flexibility in the shape of clusters, making it suitable for our dataset where games may naturally group into clusters with varying sizes and elliptical shapes. GMM's soft-clustering approach, where each point is assigned a probability of belonging to each cluster, provides a nuanced understanding of game groupings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation:\n",
    "The implementation will utilize the scikit-learn library in Python:<br>\n",
    "DBSCAN (sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN): DBSCAN(eps=n, min_samples=n), adjusting eps and min_samples based on the dataset's density.<br>\n",
    "Spectral Clustering (sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering): SpectralClustering(n_clusters=n), determining n_clusters after EDA and preliminary clustering attempts.<br>\n",
    "Gaussian Mixture Models (sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture): GaussianMixture(n_components=n, covariance_type='full'), with n_components decided based on model performance and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) scores.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Evaluation:\n",
    "Clustering performance will be evaluated using the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), and the predictive model's accuracy for discount prices will be assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).<br>"

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prediction Accuracy**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
    "\n",
    "It measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It's calculated as the average of the absolute differences between predicted values and actual values, making it a straightforward and interpretable metric for assessing price prediction accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clustering Performance**: Adjusted Ranked Index (ARI)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) measures the similarity between two clusterings, considering all pairs of samples and counting pairs that are assigned in the same or different clusters in the predicted and true clusterings. The ARI is adjusted for the chance grouping of elements, making it a more reliable metric for the quality of the clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE will give us a direct measure of the accuracy of the price predictions, while ARI will assess the effectiveness of our clustering, ensuring that the foundation for our predictions—how games are grouped based on tags and features—is sound. This dual approach allows us to optimize both the clustering of games and the accuracy of the price predictions."
